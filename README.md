### What I learned

Using min-width allowed the image to fill up the main div.

```css
    main {
        min-width: 47rem;
        display: flex;
    }
```

### Useful resources

- [Strike-through element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s) - This helped me strikethrough the paragraph. Using documentation really helps.
